			<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
			<p>The purpose of the activity was to show how energy moves from one simple machine to another</p>
			<p>The challenge was to create a rube goldburg machine using a 2’ by 2’ piece of plywood as a base.</p>
			<p>Constraints:<br>
				<ul>
				    <li>Must last for 30s</li>
				    <li>Energy has to leave at a minimum of 4 inches above ground</li>
				    <li>Must have all six simple machines (pulley, wheel and axle, wedge, inclined plane, screw, and lever)</li>
				    <li>Machine must fit in the shelfs</li>
				    <li>The energy or the ball must be transfered from the previous machine to the next.</li>
				</ul>

			<h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
            <p>We referred to past student projects before we designed our machine. We also viewed online pictures and videos to get an idea of what materials and mechanisms we could use in our project.</p>

			<h1>Project</h1>
			<p>
				We started off by deciding on a 3-platform system as the track. The ball would move across the first track on a car (satisfying the wheel and axle requirement) with a hollow center. 
				Once the car reaches the end, the ball drops through a hole in the track, proceeding to the funnel (which doubles as the screw).

			<h1>Project</h1>
			<p>
				The ball flushes itself into a path leading to the pulley. This pulley uses the potential energy of hanging weights to pull the ball up after it falls in the cup.<br>
				The pulley only moves if the ball hits the cup and dislodges it from the nail it is attached to. Although this technique did not work at first, it was solved by adding a backboard to the cup as a "thrust plate" for the ball to exert it's force on the cup.

			<p>
				The final track slows down the ball by splitting the board using walls going diagonal to eack other.
				The problem was the board leaning to the right, which was solved by adding support to the board and the leg, allowing it to sit straight.<br>
				The ball would not fit through some of the openings, so some of the openings were widened to let the ball fit through.

			<h1>Major Changes</h1>
			<p>
				Major changes include widening the second half of the track and adding horizontal strips of cardboard in order to let the ball take a zig-zag path, prolonging the execution time of the machine. The wedge was also moved from the starting to the end of the pulley where a nail dislodges the ball from its nook.

			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>
			   	The machine took an averge of 24s to complete to circute with no external stimulus.
				Problems like the pulley not triggering when the ball lands in the cup was solved by adding a backing to the cup to provide a "thrust plate" for the ball to push off off of. 
				The second major problem was unloading the ball from the pulley onto the track. This was solved by adding a magnetic trigger that releases a held ball on the receiving side of the pulley when the cup is pulled up.
				Instead of using a back-board activated pulley, it would have taken much longer to

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				In making this machine, there were many lessons to be learnt. Primarily, the limited vertical height proved a challenge, since it was the primary source of energy used to move the ball.
				Friction was important part of the machine, since it requires a certain tilt of the platofrm and therefore a loss of available height before the ball rolls, but it would be useful so as to slow the ball in order the reach the 30s marker.
				Multiple tests have to made for every mechanism, due to the reqired margin of reliability required in order to trust that part of the track to work.
